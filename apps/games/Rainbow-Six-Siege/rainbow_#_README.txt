 ==============================
 IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - If you put a comment after a line 
   of code the line of code WILL NOT WORK. 
   Make sure comments are on entirely 
   separate lines.

- Whenever changing/adding a function name be sure to update it in R6S-Short-Command-List.txt.

 - I can use mouse interactions by assigning
   shoot/aim to keyboard keys. Although I'm not 
   sure if the anti-cheat will falsely detect it as a 'hack'.

 Best Ops For Voice Cmds:
 - High health
 - Shotguns with low recoil that will take down an opponent in 1-2 shots. Especially as you do not need to have precise aim to do this.
 	* Azami's shotgun does not count as this.
 - Traps and claymores are favorable. 
 - Any automatic gun ops that have decent amount of bullets and health. 
 
 Requires:
	- See README.md for R6S requirements & required_keybinds.txt for controls.
	
 - Recommended to use earbuds. Else disable hearing voice chat so Talon does not try to voice recognize other people's words.

 Improvements needed:
	- make a way for talon to sleep but just long enough for me to say something in vc. I.e. "ignore <msg> awake" will sleep, allow me to speak, then bring it awake again.

	- Once I get used to voice cmds switch to using left hand for mouse and change sensitivity as needed.
	
	- Maybe add pop/hiss features for clicking in general- not for R6S but for all PC usage WITHOUT head/eye tracking as that doesnt work well in games like this.
	
	- Once I get pretty good: 
		* Buy a good camera/mic pair for PC.
		* Then record myself playing R6S with my voice. 
		* Have 1 video showcasing it with video cut up to show successes rather than just a 30 min straight video. 
		* Have another video showing how to get Talon Voice set up & how to use my scripts.
		* Make a new YT acc for this and maybe a tiktok to try to make $ from it?
		* That said, several ppl have tried this and they didn't get many views..
