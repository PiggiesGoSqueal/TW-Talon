# File Name: R6S-List-of-Cmds
# Author: Tom W.

IMPROVEMENTS:
	- Once I get used to voice cmds switch to using left hand for mouse and change sensitivity as needed.
	- Maybe add pop/hiss features for clicking in general- not for R6S but for all PC usage. And could add head(?) tracking if possible instead of eye tracking.
