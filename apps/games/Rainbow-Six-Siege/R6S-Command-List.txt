# File Name: R6S-List-of-Cmds
# Author: Tom W.
# Note: Cannot shorten cmds too much or it starts to misunderstand every command..

I think it got slower to load Talon with multiple R6S files. Try having it all in 1 file?

NOTE: the more cmds i add the longer it may take to load cmds! Delete the unused chat cmds & DELETE UNUSED ALIASES and special op cmds! And any others!!
