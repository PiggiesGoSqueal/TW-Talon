https://github.com/isayed037/Hand-Detection-Tracking-For-Complete-Mouse-Control
	- free
	- Control mouse with hands but using a camera and hand-tracking instead of a mouse. Might be easier than head tracking / facial expressions for precision? Would need to test. Though holding hands up 24/7 may get tiring and reduce circulation so that'd be bad for hands.
	- Last updated 3 years ago though and not popular. But done in Python.

----------------------------
Recommended to avoid eye control
for full computer control. Instead,
use head rotation or voice control for mouse cursor control if hands-free is needed.
----------------------------
KinesicMouse LIVE
	- Best I've found so far. Just need to figure out how to use another method than iPhone. See links below using MeFaMo on Github.
	- Purpose: Control keyboard and mouse with facial expressions. Also allows you to move mouse over screen using head movements.
	- Website: https://kinesicmouse.xcessity.at/buy/
	- Cost: ~$100 (14 day free trial)
	- Hardware required: iPhone X+ with Face recog
	- Possible alternative to iPhone:
		* https://github.com/JimWest/MeFaMo
		* see for instructions: https://forums.xcessity.at/viewtopic.php?p=10671&sid=c89783ca45a06b24af67d261f8084c32#p10671
	- Pros:
		* Responds QUICKLY.
		* Pretty/very accurate
		* 
	- Cons:
		* Relies on iPhone camera with face detection. And this causes the iPhone to overheat after a short period of time. 
		* Also would harm battery over time. 
		* have to place iPhone in a raised place where it can easily see whole face.
