Conclusions:
	- (Head/Eye/Face tracking software) Facial recognition software using 3D cameras (I.e. KinesicMouse LIVE)... As for face recognition using 2D cameras.. It is prob worse but idk. The 2 software I've found were not sufficient (AITrack/OpenTrack and MeFaMo+KinesicMouse instead of iPhone+KinesicMouse)
		* may be decent for individuals that want to connect certain keys / mouse clicks to facial expressions. However, it's not great at moving your mouse PRECISELY for small buttons on your screen and requires lots of practice. Even when your head is still it may still move your mouse some. 
		* Head tracking software should not be used for FPS games. Moves your POV too much and is disorienting/hard to aim. May be okay for someone that practices a lot with it but eh.. If you have a choice do not use it.

	- free
	- Control mouse with hands but using a camera and hand-tracking instead of a mouse. Might be easier than head tracking / facial expressions for precision? Would need to test. Though holding hands up 24/7 may get tiring and reduce circulation so that'd be bad for hands.
	- Last updated 3 years ago though and not popular. But done in Python.

Eye control would at least be worth trying.

KinesicMouse LIVE
	- Best I've found so far. Just need to figure out how to use another method than iPhone. See links below using MeFaMo on Github.
	- Purpose: Control keyboard and mouse with facial expressions. Also allows you to move mouse over screen using head movements.
	- Website: https://kinesicmouse.xcessity.at/buy/
	- Cost: ~$100 (14 day free trial)
	- Hardware required: iPhone X+ with Face recog
	- For someone who truly cannot use a mouse/keyboard it may be helpful. Though it is difficult to replace the mouse with this software and have it be precise. Also I learned head movement instead of a mouse is.. basically just a major pain in FPS games. Moves screen too much. Disorienting. Hard to aim. Does not always recognize facial expressions. 
		* see for instructions: https://forums.xcessity.at/viewtopic.php?p=10671&sid=c89783ca45a06b24af67d261f8084c32#p10671
	- Pros:
		* Responds pretty QUICKLY.
		* 
	- Cons:
		* Must use 30 FPS on iPhone or it'll cause it to overheat. But that's okay to use 30 FPS. If you want 60 FPS buy an iPhone heatsink.
		* Even at the lowest setting, head movements will move your character's POV too quickly and make it very difficult to aim or do anything. Is disorienting. You could change it to move POV only when doing diff facial expressions perhaps- but you'd still run into all the other problems.
		* Even when your head is 100% still it will still move the player's POV. 
		* Also would harm battery over time. Though dev claims you can leave it plugged in and new phones will use charge from charger instead of battery. 
		* have to place iPhone in a raised place where it can easily see whole face. Use a phone stand.


Enable Viacam (TRY TO USE ALONGSIDE TALON HISS/POP click noises. If possible maybe allow pop #1 to zoom in for more precise clicking and pop #2 to click it. There is MacOS support for this but idk if there is a Windows one made yet. Alternatively use Tobi Eye Tracker + Talon Voice)
	- Purpose: Hands-Free mouse control. Supports Win 7, 8, 10. Idk about 11.
	- Website: 
		* Official site: https://eviacam.crea-si.com/
		* Source code: https://github.com/cmauri/eviacam
	- Cost: Free
	- Hardware required: A good quality camera 
	- Pros:
		* Works pretty well.
		* Configure whether mouse clicks when staying on something for a period of time or disable click function and use alternative methods like foot mouse pedals or pop/hiss from Talon Voice to click. 
	- Cons:
		* Head tracking might get exhausting for head/neck for those not used to it but can also move body instead. 
		* Best when used with a mouse to occassionally reposition the mouse in the center. However, you could use Talon Voice and just set it to move the mouse to the center of the screen instead. B/c sometimes it will have the center of your screen = your head in a weird spot. So you need to recallibrate (you can do so via the software but easier/quicker to just use your mouse to recenter it) 


Iris (NOT RECOMMENDED)
	- Purpose: Move mouse by moving head. Basic click with mouse feature by hovering over buttons for X time. Can add basic interact buttons you hover over to click diff keybinds. Is basically a more limited version of the KinesicMouse LIVE software (same dev) but cheaper.  
	- Website: https://iris.xcessity.at/index.php#about
	- Cost: 
	- Hardware required: Tobi(?) EyeTracker X(?)
	- Pros:
		* 
	- Cons:
		* Very basic, costs $, not as good as KinesicMouse. 

SmyleMouse (Not recommended, too basic & pricy)
	- Purpose: Smile to click. That's it. Super basic. 
	- Website: https://smylemouse.com/
	- Cost: $500 for lifetime usage (or $30/month)
	- Hardware required: A standard camera 
	- Pros:
		* Only requires a camera 
	- Cons:
		* EXPENSIVE!
		* Very basic features. Smile to click. That's literally it. Can double click but nothing more and no other facial expressions supported.
