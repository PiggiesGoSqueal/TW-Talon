=============================
WEEKEND GOAL:
	1. Figure out a solution to replace mouse for PC usage at work and home (for non-gaming).
		- Order a Tobi 5 after confirming free returns. Then use with Talon Voice to pop once for zoom and pop twice for click. Figure out how to double click etc.
		- Research Windows 11 accessibility features.
	
	2. Figure out how to replace keyboard in R6S using Parrot.py for sound effects. Sound effects are much quicker than voice recognition scripts.
		- Read THIS FIRST: 
			* https://github.com/ziemus/knausj_talon/blob/main/core/modes/game_mode/README.md
			
		- https://github.com/chaosparrot/parrot.py
	
	3. Figure out how to replace mouse in R6S using Tobi 5 if I can get it to work with head or eye tracking (try both). Though I do not have high hopes for this.
		- quadstick would be a pain but may be most effective. Could cause neck pain tho

	
According to Talon's Slack (1 person) it is best to NOT use Dragon with Talon unless it is really needed. Conformer AI works well. 
=============================

Figure out if reducing R6S cmds listed improves reaction time of Talon (backup first)
